# h
Abstracted vanilla JavaScript DOM manipulation

Enables you to manipulate the Document Object Model in an abstracted way using vanilla JavaScript.

See what an example router in vanilla JS looks like in r.js, where you will also find a demo of modularity using the h.js() function.

Started writing this in 2013; my first return to JavaScript after finishing supporting my last ActionScript 2 project.

Bought the domain in 2014, let it lapse, and bought it again in 2018. Decided to make a GitHub account in 2022, and uploaded this.
